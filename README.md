# Polka-Survival
Helper mod for my RDR2 Walk Across The Continent challenge. 

Does two things
1. Provides a tool to generate random checkpoints to navigate towards
2. Provides a tool to make judgment calls if loot is accessable from a road or not.

# Installation
Make sure you have [ScriptHookRDR2DotNet-V2](https://github.com/Halen84/ScriptHookRDR2DotNet-V2) installed.

Unzip the contents of [the release](https://github.com/PolkaCowboy/The-Road/releases/) into your RedDeadRedemption2 folder. Resulting structure should be `../RedDeadRedemption2/scripts/TheRoad.dll`

# Use
Press `F10` to toggle detection for if you are on the road.
Press `F11` to generate the next checkpoint. 

Checkpoint won't be saved if the game reloads.
